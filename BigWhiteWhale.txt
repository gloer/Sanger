Big White Whale 

Vers
Am                                     G
Leaving my home and friends I´m going alone
           Am
I´m going alone

I´m not very old you can say
                   G
I´m just no longer young
              Am
I´m no longer young

Ref:
     C
I´ll go for Australia, for Australia
Am
Leaving behind, all that is mine
     C
I´ll go for Australia, for Australia
Am              
Leaving behind, all that is mine
G                Am
         that is mine

Del 2
G                            Em
We sang and we danced to the wind and the rain
Hm        D
Everybody smiled, we were all the same
G                              Em
We drank to the stories of the Big White Whale
Hm                     D
Did it really take his leg?

x 2

But how should I know
And why should I Care
Doesn´t really matter to me?????
