'Bout the time my daddy left to fight the big war
  E                                  B
I saw my first pistol in the general store
       B
In the general store, I was thirteen
  B                                 E
I thought it was the finest thing I ever had seen
E
Asked if I could have it someday when I grew up
                                          B
Mama dropped a dozen eggs and really blew up
    B
She really blew up, I didn't understand
B                           E
Mama said the pistol is the devil's right hand


CHORUS:
    A
The devil's right hand
    E       A     E
The devil's right hand
B                           E
Mama said the pistol is the devil's right hand.

My very first pistol was a cap and ball colt.
Shoot as fast as lightnin' but she'd load a might slow.
Load a might slow. I soon found out it'll
Get you into trouble,but it can't get you out.
So then I went and bought myself a colt 45.
It was called a peace maker, but i never knew why.
Never knew why, I didn't understand.
Mama says the pistol is the devil's right hand.

CHORUS:

       F#
Well I got into a card game in a company town
F#                                         C#
Caught a miner cheatin' and I shot the dog down
  C#
I shot the dog down, I watched the man fall
C#                               F#
Never touched his holster, never had a chance to draw
    F#
The trial was in the morning and they drug me outta bed
     F#                                   C#
They asked me how i pleaded, not guilty I said
    C#
Not guilty I said, you got the wrong man
C#                                 F#
Nothin touched the trigger but the devils right hand
