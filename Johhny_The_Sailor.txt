Johhny is sitting in a pub on Leicester square
                                 G        D
It´s his seventh dry whiskey but noone do care
     G                         D
He´s drinking and drinking and soon he´ll be dead
A                          G              D
Ordering more whiskey in a glass coloured red

For seven long years he sailed the seven seas
                        G              D
Dreaming bout his baby, waiting on the quay
     G                          D
But when he came home there was noone there for him
             A                       G                            D
She had been married five years, had two children and a dog named Jim

So give me a bottle of whiskey
G                   D
Give me a barrel of rum
      A       
Cause depression has set in
    G                  D
And I know my time has come
