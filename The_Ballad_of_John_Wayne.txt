The Ballad of John Wayne

Dm                           F
Sitting on a train bound for Texas
A                      Dm
Sitting drinking wine, wasting my time
                  F
Then some scumbag starts a fight
      A                           Dm
And I shoot him right through his head
A#        A                       Dm
               Right through his head


Dm                          F
I´m a man you don´t want to meet on the street
A                            Dm
I´m a man you can smell from two hundred feet
                             F
I have a lot of women and my drinking is hard
    A                   Dm
The end of my life in a graveyard
A#                 A         Dm
    The end of my life in a graveyard

Mellomspill - samme som vers


Vers - dempet og dramatisk

Dm                         F
As I touch the trigger the sun goes red
    A                     Dm
The stain of blood in the warm summer day
                           F
As I see the smoke from my pistol vanish
A                    Dm
     I can feel he´s dead
A#        A         Dm
    I can see he´s dead
