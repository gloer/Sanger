The Ballad of John Wayne

Am                           C
Sitting on a train bound for Texas
E                      Am
Sitting drinking wine, wasting my time
                  C
Then some scumbag starts a fight
      E                           Am
And I shoot him right through his head
F        E                       Am
               Right through his head


Am                          C
I´m a man you don´t want to meet on the street
E                            Am
I´m a man you can smell from two hundred feet
                             C
I have a lot of women and my drinking is hard
    E                   Am
The end of my life in a graveyard
F                 E         Am
    The end of my life in a graveyard

Am                         C
As I touch the trigger the sun goes red
    E                     Am
The stain of blood in the warm summer day
                           C
As I see the smoke from my pistol vanish
E                    Am
     I can feel he´s dead
F         E         Am
    I can see he´s dead
